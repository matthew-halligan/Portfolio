            <p>As a student from Connecticut Studying Computer Science at Universtiy of Vermont,
            I've always had an interest in computers.  I had been looking into web development for
            several months before coming to University and gave it a shot on FreeCodeCamp.org.  
            Learning the basics of HTML and CSS gave me a good base prior to coming to Vermont and I 
            was able to focus much more energy into learning php in my development classes.</p>
            
            <p>These first two years of classes have given me the tools that I need to make 
            any project idea come into a reality. This confidence has been the base to my mission of 
            growing your business into the online world.</p>
