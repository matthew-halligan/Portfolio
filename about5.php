                    <p>As a student from Connecticut Studying Computer Science at Universtiy of Vermont, I've always had an interest in computers. I had been looking into web development for several months before coming to University and gave it a shot on FreeCodeCamp.org. Learning the basics of HTML and CSS gave me a good base prior to coming to Vermont and I was able to focus much more energy into learning php in my development classes.</p>

                    <p>These first two years of classes have given me the tools that I need to make any project idea come into a reality. This confidence has been the base to my mission of growing your business into the online world.</p>
